It's been quite a hectic couple of months for me and today is probably the first time that I've felt alone.

I know that it sounds like a bad thing, but there hasn't been much of an opportunity for me to just sit down and reflect on what has been happening in my life.

- I was a Precious Metals Dealer for Acetop Precious Metals based in Hong Kong.
- I took a General Assembly Front End Web Development class in May 2013.
- I left my Dealer job to become a Developer in August 2013.
- I joined Imagination Hong Kong a week after I left my previous job.

I'm the type of person who likes to keep busy... 

Like... 

...

Really busy.

I remember a story about where James Brown got his work ethic. It was a story about how hard his father had to work, doing all kinds of jobs... and he was only out of work 7 days throughout his entire life.

Think about that...

7 days.

You might be thinking...

"But... I'm not the father of the Godfather of Soul"

Yes - you might not be... 

but YOU could BE the influence for someone to make a change.

I remembered during my times at University as a pinnicle phase of my life...

...where I had become disappointed at my life choices.

I didn't REALLY know what I was doing and didn't have the confidence to admit to myself that I was feeling lost.

When I went into University, I had the feeling that I could do a degree in the fastest pace possible and that I even entertained with the idea of doing a sandwich degree (doing full year work experience inbetween my degree).

I had listened to professors (whenever I went to the prospective interviews) that doing work experience inbetween would not be the wisest of decisions...

I accepted that advice as if those very professors knew WHO I was...

but... Why did I?

At the time, I believed that people older than I was, whether they were teachers or my older peers knew best...

but... How did I come to that conclusion?

I never realised at the time that I was responsible to make the final decision... 

I had failed my year, and had to spend a summer in order to retake my year. During that summer, I had felt depressed and lost and needed motivation to get through the summer on my own.

It was around this time that I discovered Tony Robbins and Robin Sharma. The inspirational people that I gravitated towards was Ghandi and Einstein. 

    ..."Be the change you want to see"

What does it mean to enjoy life? - to Really be content on life itself?
