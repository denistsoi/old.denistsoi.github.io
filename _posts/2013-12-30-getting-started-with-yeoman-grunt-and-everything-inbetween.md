It's day one of Getting Started with Yeoman, something that I've needed to do that is long overdue.

The reason for documenting all this stuff is due to the fact that I've felt completely lost when knowing where to begin, so I wish to document all the good, bad and ugly things that I've encountered.

Sources I've found so far.

###[Addy Osmani's FOWA 2013 London Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/addyosmani/automating-front-end-workflow)
