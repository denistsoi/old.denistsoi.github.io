      <p>Going for Gold&#8230;</p>

<p>Today I handed my resignation letter. I&#8217;ve been spouting about doing it for ages now, probably for months. (and for the facebook community, you must be sick to death by it so I apologize in advance). I guess the thing that always frightened me was always the fear of uncertainty&#8230; the fear of having nothing to do and no money coming in.</p>

<p>However, this past year has been incredible.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve experienced so many obstacles and personal disappointments&#8230; but they&#8217;ve all lead me to appreciate the incredible relationships that I&#8217;ve made; all within the Hong Kong community. From appreciating Eric, my older brother, confidant and most trusted advisor&#8230; to the many inspiring people that have shown nothing but support by sharing their stories of trials and tribulations. I&#8217;m not entirely sure how I feel&#8230; but the closest thing would be a mix of uncertainty and fear to relief, determination and elation.</p>

<p>Last night at Hackjam, I experienced a very moving conversation with Tom Grek and how he realized that all the fear from leaving a safe job were completely unfounded. That with talent and skill, work will always come your way.</p>

<p>&#8230;</p>

<p>That really stuck with me.</p>

<p>I mean&#8230;</p>

<p>It made me realize, that with all the projects; from PrinterLinker and receiving support from the Makible team, being a Community Organizer for Dim Sum Labs, a GA Evangelist and Hacker For hire; that they all give me PLENTY of things to do&#8230; and somehow&#8230; it makes perfect sense just to &#8220;go for gold&#8221;.</p>

<p>Though I have to mention something which is a slight tangent.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t do well in crowds and whenever I&#8217;m in a situation where I&#8217;m in front of a group of people, I have to sum up ALL my courage and energy to try and make every word have an emotive impact.</p>

<p>For someone that doesn&#8217;t like to talk or appear showy&#8230; it helps to assume an identity&#8230; THAT being the identity of a &#8220;Community Organizer&#8221; for DSL.</p>

<p>I guess the &#8220;Community Organizer&#8221; is the guy who always gives a little more than they&#8217;re normally used to. The person who offers a helping hand when someone needs it. The person who holds their tongue to avoid offending someone and having a partition of patience when they&#8217;re extremely tired. The person who says &#8220;hi&#8221; not because they&#8217;re trained to do it, but because something inside them tells them that they HAVE to.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen people I admire do the above (and also have the pleasure of calling my friends). The past few months, I&#8217;ve seen notable three people do this to extremes: Mart Van de Ven, Allison Baum, Graham Leach (&amp; DSL).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen Mart do this, almost to a fault, on numerous occasions and I&#8217;m always impressed every time he does this. Like, it&#8217;s impeccable. I mean, having a job is tough enough in HK, but to do that AND to teach at twice a week with newbies like myself? - &#8230; I wonder, &#8220;does the passion for learning burn so brightly that it gives people energy to extinguish negativity and doubt?&#8221;&#8230; It must do. I remember talking to Mart after our last FEWD class and mentioning how if I had someone with Mart&#8217;s energy and positivity during my Secondary education, I would have became a Computer Scientist rather than delving into finance. It&#8217;s with him agreeing to BEING that person for people now that really inspires me to do more, not just for myself, but for people like myself.</p>

<p>With Allison calling herself a self-professed introvert, it amazes me how she can drive that energy and kindness when talking to people. It&#8217;s hard work, for any startup, to say or even prove that your product is far superior to anything out there. It&#8217;s even harder trying to convince people that the curriculum and community that GA provides has more advantages that going Solo. Whenever I go some of these GA info sessions, I sometimes get a feeling of reluctance from people&#8230; I mean &#8220;Why&#8221; would anyone in their right mind purchase a product to learn?&#8230; then I&#8217;d answer with&#8230; &#8220;Why&#8221; are people getting better paid jobs with perks in the Tech Community?&#8230; Think about it this way, The current renaissance that exists is IN TECH. NOT in Finance. If you want to be EXCELLENT - then TECH is the EASIEST way to do just THAT. I&#8217;m not saying you have to quit your job and start a business to make your first million. Frankly, I couldn&#8217;t care less if I do or not&#8230; What I AM saying is&#8230; when I&#8217;m long into my career, what kind of skills would I want to have I picked up that will STILL be applicable? - I will be damned if I get replaced by a factory of robotic coders.</p>

<p>Finally, with Graham Leach. He comes across as someone pretty intense and radical. Not being satisfied with the status quo - he&#8217;s inspired me to be &#8220;Tenacious against Complacency&#8221;. Honestly&#8230; It&#8217;s intimidating being apart of a Hackerspace/Makerspace. People around you are Incredibly smart, more experienced at things that you&#8217;ve never heard about. However, they are an incredible group of people that provide the utmost support whenever they see you struggling. They&#8217;ve all gone through it&#8230; and often, having the courage to just ask after experiencing some struggle will help IMMENSELY.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know a lot of people in the startup community personally. I mean, I wish I had the time to get to know people. It takes me a couple of weeks to get to hear people&#8217;s stories. &#8220;Why did they choose to be in Hong Kong?&#8221;, &#8220;What are their interests?&#8221;, &#8220;what problems are they trying to solve now?&#8221; - I mean, stack those three questions and multiply that with the numerous people in the community&#8230; That&#8217;s A LOT of man hours! It isn&#8217;t that I don&#8217;t want to know WHO you are&#8230; it&#8217;s just that I can&#8217;t physically do it all and STILL go for GOLD. Even though we&#8217;re all in the same boat one way or another, it&#8217;s deeply moving that people say a short hello or a few words of encouragement. I mean, everyone I&#8217;ve mentioned today, they&#8217;ve all gone through the troughs in the valley of despair&#8230; but we&#8217;re all in the same journey for different reasons. I think that this positivity should occur more often in the community. Don&#8217;t come into the scene thinking you&#8217;re gonna be the next Facebook&#8230; do it because you can and it&#8217;s the right thing to do.</p>

<p>So in summary&#8230; If you&#8217;re feeling good about yourself&#8230; share the gold&#8230; give some positive encouragement to someone who needs it&#8230; shake the hand of someone you haven&#8217;t met before&#8230; you never know&#8230; you might need a little encouragement when you need it most.</p>

<p>To the people who inspire me, to those who have said a few friendly words and to those who continue to give me support&#8230; Thank You. D</p>
