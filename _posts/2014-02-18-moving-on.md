It's just been over a month since I left Imagination to continue my career as a web developer for Makible.  

I haven't had the time to properly write down what I've felt since leaving Imagination (though on good terms), but due to my own insecurities, I spent a fair amount of time thinking about my own flaws and weaknesses when it came to my departure from Imag.  

I learned a lot as a junior and I am sincerely grateful for the memories and experiences that I had gained from such a short period of time, albeit with a hint of trepidation throughout my time at the company.

It's strange thinking about it really, I mean, how do I logically summarize my experiences at my first job as a web developer?

Well it was a bit too short to really give it justice. Althrough I was given a very insightful glimpse into this new world, I ultimately felt worthless in not being able to hold my own in a team which had so much to offer to anyone who was willing to learn.

It took a while for me to feel responsible. 

To feel responsible for my wellbeing, my own learning and my own future.
