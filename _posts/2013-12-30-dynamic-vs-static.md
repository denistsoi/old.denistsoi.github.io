Whilst working at Imagination as my first job as a web developer, I overheard a lot of conversations between "Static vs Dynamic Languages".

Now what do they mean? - 

I started programming with Visual Basic in my teens and got into my first programming language with using C (to program Arduinos)...

but the conversation between Static and Dynamic Languages never came up...

What's the big deal?

Well - there's a couple of good arguments for both in the article above [link again](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/04/18/introduction-to-programming-type-systems/)

I don't have much to add to the topic, but hope you enjoy the above article.
