<!-- ...I encountered  file and I hope I can outline some scenarios so you too can avoid the eventual faceplant same pitfalls that I almost faceplanted.
 -->
<p>Basically, from GA FEWD and in Frontend, you will want to import custom font files that are either hosted locally or on a CDN like <a href='http://www.google.com/fonts'>google fonts</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to include a open font type, you will need to include the <code>@font face</code> within your CSS. Thereafter, you&#8217;ll be able to control what elements you want that font style applied into your webpage.</p>

<p>Below is an example of how you&#8217;ll go about doing that.</p>

<pre><code>@font-face
{
font-family: myAwesomeFont;  
src: url(awesomeFont.ttf), local(awesomeFont);  
}</code></pre>

<p>Then in your stylesheet under your specified class, id or element, you&#8217;ll need to add this onto your choice of element. (I&#8217;ve used body as the example)</p>

<pre><code>body
{
font-family: myAwesomeFont;
}</code></pre>

<p>Caveat: Font face is not supported on ie8 and under.</p>

<h4 id='so_whats_the_problem'>So what&#8217;s the problem?</h4>

<p>Well, the problem was as follows - Traditional Chinese was being rendered onto the DOM, along with the Simplified Chinese - so what was the problem?</p>

<p>Whenever I looked at the Mac version of the site, the Simplified Chinese was being rendered with a system font which looked incredibly similar to the desired style that I wanted to render. However, whenever this was rendered on a Windows Machine on Chrome (running the exact same browser), the Windows system font would actually a very different font style?</p>

<p>So what was actually happening?</p>

<p>I had hypothesized that the Traditional Chinese font file was renderering <em>SOME</em> of the Simplified Chinese, but the curious case was why was it rendering only some and not <em>ALL</em> of the characters?</p>

<p>This lead me onto a deep and dark rabbit hole which would inevitably lead me to some very intereresting caveats about using font types.</p>

<p>As Web Developers, we all know that the openness of the web was not created for font foundries in mind. That being said, any font that isn&#8217;t openly licensed or legally purchased will be liable to some bad times&#8230;</p>

<p><img alt='Bad Time' src='http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/500x/44606316.jpg' /></p>

<h4 id='update'>Update</h4>

<p>Anyways - that Tangent aside, my colleague Ethan had a quick look around at the most popular only font foundaries about why the font files had specific naming.</p>

<p>There was a peculiar naming scheme of &#8220;Simplified on Traditional&#8221;&#8230;</p>

<p>Which meant&#8230;</p>

<p>That for whatever Traditional Chinese character code will be translated into Simplified Chinese via the font file&#8230;</p>
