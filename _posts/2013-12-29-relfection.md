# Reflection

It's been a while since my last post.

I've been busy at work to the detrement of a lot of things and I'm glad that I've taken the time over the Christmas Holidays to reflect and relive the past few months since I joined Imagination.

I always knew that this job as a web dev was going to be tough, but I never knew that the final month before Christmas would ultimately test my physical and mental limit.

Admittantly, I began to feel exhausted before Christmas, where most of the deadlines were due. I had the mental approach of giving as much time as possible towards work, to the detrement of my social and family life. I had felt like I hadn't enjoyed my time since most of it was dedicated to work. I realised that I can't do that if I were to come back after the New Year, and my lifestyle (life choices) had to change.

I've had a lot of conversations with Vladimir over the past few months about what I should be focusing when it came to my learning process. And although there are a lot of things that I do not know, I realised yesterday that I have to dedicate time towards study.

This means, having the same approach of "going back to school", when it came to improving my programming skills.

I hope this blog post can serve as a commitment to myself to seeing how much I can learn and ultimately share in the next couple of months.

... I hope this Christmas break has helped give you the same realisations for the new year.
