<p>It&#8217;s been a while since my last post.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been busy at work to the detrement of a lot of things and I&#8217;m glad that I&#8217;ve taken the time over the Christmas Holidays to reflect and relive the past few months since I joined Imagination.</p>

<p>I always knew that this job as a web dev was going to be tough, but I never knew that the final month before Christmas would ultimately test my physical and mental limit.</p>

<p>Admittantly, I began to feel exhausted before Christmas, where most of the deadlines were due. I had the mental approach of giving as much time as possible towards work, to the detrement of my social and family life. I had felt like I hadn&#8217;t enjoyed my time since most of it was dedicated to work. I realised that I can&#8217;t do that if I were to come back after the New Year, and my lifestyle (life choices) had to change.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had a lot of conversations with <a href='https://twitter.com/rusintez'>Vladimir</a> over the past few months about what I should be focusing when it came to my learning process. And although there are a lot of things that I do not know, I realised yesterday that I have to dedicate time towards study.</p>

<p>This means, having the same approach of &#8220;going back to school&#8221;, when it came to improving my programming skills.</p>

<p>I hope this blog post can serve as a commitment to myself to seeing how much I can learn and ultimately share in the next couple of months.</p>

<p>&#8230;<br />&#8230;<br />&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230; I hope this Christmas break has helped give you the same realisations for the new year.</p>
