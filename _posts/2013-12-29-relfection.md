# Relection

It's been a while since my last post.

I've been busy at work to the detrement of a lot of things, and I'm glad that I've taken the time over the Christmas Holidays to reflect and relive the past few months since I joined Imagination.

I always knew that this job as a web dev was going to be tough, especially at Imaginaiton, but I never knew that the final month before Christmas break would ultimately test my physical and mental limit.

Admittantly, I began to feel exhausted towards the last couple of months before Christmas, where most of the deadlines were due. I had the mental approach of giving as much time as possible towards work, to the detrement of my social and family life. I had felt like I hadn't enjoyed my time since most of it was dedicated to work. I realised that I can't do that if I were to come back after the New Year, and my lifestyle (life choices) had to change.
