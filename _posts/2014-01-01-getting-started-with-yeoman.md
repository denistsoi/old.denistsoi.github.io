### Continuing onwards  

Using Yeoman with Angular-Generator [Link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1fvdO9GY#t=113)  

Install Yeoman globally with  


``$ npm install -g yo``  
``$ npm install -g generator-angular``


Make a new directory of where you want to put your app  


``$ mkdir todo``  
``$ cd todo``  
``$ yo angular`` 


If everything went well, then run  

``$ grunt server``
